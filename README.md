### Define methods in controllers

In this exercise we use `ng-click` as an example to learn how to define methods in controllers. Defining controller methods are 
the same as defining $scope variables -- just attach the function body onto the ```$scope``` variable.

`ng-click` is one of Angular's built-in event. It triggers a click event. It can be placed on buttons, hyperlinks and so on, followed by 
the method to run when the element is clicked.

Angular promotes reusing and extending HTML. So many operations are defined as attributes on the element. Later we will see how to 
extend the HTML language when learning directives.
